into note partitions, the second converts audio data into images, and the final layer classifies those images

• Manually created a median of 100 samples of flute audio across 24 classes which were recorded in
different locations. <br><br>
• Executed data augmentation techniques including background noise addition, audio shifting, audio
stretching, and SpecAugment—to generate over 7,000 augmented samples.<br><br>
• Architected and developed a ResNet-50-inspired model, achieving 95% accuracy and a 94% F1 score.<br><br>
• Developed a mobile application featuring a three-layer processing pipeline: the first layer segments audio
into note partitions, the second converts audio data into images, and the final layer classifies those images
using the trained deep learning model.
